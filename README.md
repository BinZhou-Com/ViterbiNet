# ViterbiNet
A deep learning based Viterbi algorithm for symbol detection, based on the paper:

N. Shlezinger, N. Farsad, Y. C. Eldar, and A. J. Goldsmith. 

“ViterbiNet: A deep learning based Viterbi algorithm for symbol detection”. 

arXiv preprint, arXiv:1905.10750, 2019.


The implementation of ViterbiNet consists of two functions:

  GetViterbiNet - generate and train ViterbiNet detector.
  
  ApplyViterbiNet - use trained model to detect symbols.
  
A code example for evaluating ViterbiNet can be found in the script Test_ViterbiNet.m

This code requires Matlab with deep learning toolbox.
